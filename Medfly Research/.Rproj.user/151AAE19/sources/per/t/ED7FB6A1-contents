  {"id":"careyDietShapesMortality2016","abstract":"Despite the importance of trauma in healthspan and lifespan in humans as well as in non-human species, with one important exception the literature in both gerontology and ecology contains virtually no experimental demographic studies concerned with trauma in any species. We used dietary manipulation [full diet (F) versus sugar-only (S)] to produce four levels of frailty in 55-day old tephritid fruit flies (Anastrepha ludens) that were then subject to the trauma of cage transfer stress (n = 900/sex in each of the 4 treatments). The key results included the following: (1) there is a trauma effect caused by the transfer that depends on previous diet before transfer, new diet after transfer and gender of the fly; (2) males are more vulnerable than females; (3) if initial diet was F, flies are relatively immune against the trauma, and the subsequent diet (F or S) does not matter; (4) however if initial diet was S, then the effect of the trauma depends largely on the diet after the transfer; (5) flies transferred from S to F diets do very well in terms of remaining longevity (i.e. greatest remaining longevity), while flies transferred from S to S diet do poorly (i.e. shortest remaining longevity). We discuss both the strengths and weaknesses of this study and implications of the results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Carey","given":"James R"},{"family":"Liedo","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jane-Ling"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Hans-Georg"},{"family":"Su","given":"Yu-Ru"},{"family":"Vaupel","given":"James W"}],"container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0158468","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,6]]},"PMCID":"PMC4934917","PMID":"27383645","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Diet Shapes Mortality Response to Trauma in Old Tephritid Fruit Flies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934917/","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"carrollFdapaceFunctionalData2020","abstract":"A versatile package that provides implementation of various methods of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and Empirical Dynamics. The core of this package is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a key technique for functional data analysis, for sparsely or densely sampled random trajectories and time courses, via the Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation (PACE) algorithm. This core algorithm yields covariance and mean functions, eigenfunctions and principal component (scores), for both functional data and derivatives, for both dense (functional) and sparse (longitudinal) sampling designs. For sparse designs, it provides fitted continuous trajectories with confidence bands, even for subjects with very few longitudinal observations. PACE is a viable and flexible alternative to random effects modeling of longitudinal data. There is also a Matlab version (PACE) that contains some methods not available on fdapace and vice versa. Updates to fdapace were supported by grants from NIH Echo and NSF DMS-1712864 and DMS-2014626.

  {"id":"FunctionalPrincipalComponent2020","abstract":"Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is a statistical method for investigating the dominant modes of variation of functional data. Using this method,  a random function is represented in the eigenbasis, which is an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space L2 that consists of the  eigenfunctions of the autocovariance operator. FPCA represents functional data in the most parsimonious way, in the sense that when using a fixed number of basis functions, the eigenfunction basis explains more variation than any other basis expansion. FPCA can be applied for representing random functions, or in functional regression and classification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,11]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,5]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 949293605","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Functional principal component analysis","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_principal_component_analysis&oldid=949293605"},

  {"id":"mullerEarlyMortalitySurge1997","abstract":"Experiments based on over 400,000 medf lies revealed that females maintained on a normal diet (sucrose plus protein) have a higher life expectancy than males maintained on a normal diet, with a difference of 1.30 ؎ 0.27 days in favor of females. However, this sex differential reverses under protein deprivation, with a difference of 2.24 ؎ 0.18 days in favor of males. The reversal of the male–female life expectancy differential is caused by a sustained surge in early female mortality under protein deprivation that is tied to egg-laying and physiological processes. In contrast, male mortality and life expectancy are only mildly affected by protein deprivation. The surge in early mortality for female medf ly cohorts is an instance of a vulnerable period. These vulnerable periods are linked with patterns in hazard rates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Muller","given":"H.-G."},{"family":"Wang","given":"J.-L."},{"family":"Capra","given":"W.

Supine onset increased the mortality risk by 39.5-fold and a unit increase in supine level increased mortality by 26.3%. The discovery that behavioural traits in insects can be used as biomarkers of their health and to predict their time to death has important implications regarding research on morbidity dynamics, behavioural neuroethology and gerontology, and the interpretation of longevity extension in model organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Papadopoulos","given":"Nikos T"},{"family":"Carey","given":"James R"},{"family":"Katsoyannos","given":"Byron I"},{"family":"Kouloussis","given":"Nikos A"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Hans-Georg"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xueli"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2002.2078","ISSN":"0962-8452","issue":"1501","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,8,22]]},"page":"1633-1637","PMCID":"PMC1691077","PMID":"12204122","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Supine behaviour predicts the time to death in male Mediterranean fruitflies (Ceratitis capitata).","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691077/","volume":"269"},

This manuscript crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from simple intuitions, the mathematics behind PCA. This tutorial does not shy away from explaining the ideas informally, nor does it shy away from the mathematics. The hope is that by addressing both aspects, readers of all levels will be able to gain a better understanding of PCA as well as the when, the how and the why of applying this technique.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shlens","given":"Jonathon"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1404.1100 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,3]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1100"},

  {"id":"SurvivalAnalysis2020","abstract":"Survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. This topic is called reliability theory or reliability analysis in engineering, duration analysis or duration modelling in economics, and event history analysis in sociology. Survival analysis attempts to answer certain questions, such as what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival?\nTo answer such questions, it is necessary to define \"lifetime\". In the case of biological survival, death is unambiguous, but for mechanical reliability, failure may not be well-defined, for there may well be mechanical systems in which failure is partial, a matter of degree, or not otherwise localized in time. Even in biological problems, some events (for example, heart attack or other organ failure) may have the same ambiguity. The theory outlined below assumes well-defined events at specific times; other cases may be better treated by models which explicitly account for ambiguous events.\nMore generally, survival analysis involves the modelling of time to event data; in this context, death or failure is considered an \"event\" in the survival analysis literature – traditionally only a single event occurs for each subject, after which the organism or mechanism is dead or broken. Recurring event or repeated event models relax that assumption. The study of recurring events is relevant in systems reliability, and in many areas of social sciences and medical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,29]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 991415669","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Survival analysis","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Survival_analysis&oldid=991415669"}
