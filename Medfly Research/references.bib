	abstract = {Despite the importance of trauma in healthspan and lifespan in humans as well as in non-human species, with one important exception the literature in both gerontology and ecology contains virtually no experimental demographic studies concerned with trauma in any species. We used dietary manipulation [full diet (F) versus sugar-only (S)] to produce four levels of frailty in 55-day old tephritid fruit flies (Anastrepha ludens) that were then subject to the trauma of cage transfer stress (n = 900/sex in each of the 4 treatments). The key results included the following: (1) there is a trauma effect caused by the transfer that depends on previous diet before transfer, new diet after transfer and gender of the fly; (2) males are more vulnerable than females; (3) if initial diet was F, flies are relatively immune against the trauma, and the subsequent diet (F or S) does not matter; (4) however if initial diet was S, then the effect of the trauma depends largely on the diet after the transfer; (5) flies transferred from S to F diets do very well in terms of remaining longevity (i.e. greatest remaining longevity), while flies transferred from S to S diet do poorly (i.e. shortest remaining longevity). We discuss both the strengths and weaknesses of this study and implications of the results.},

	abstract = {Over 97\% of the 203 male medflies monitored in a lifetime study of their behaviour exhibited what we term supine behaviour (temporary upside-down orientation) starting an average of 16.1 days prior to their death (mean lifespan of 61.7 days). Supine onset increased the mortality risk by 39.5-fold and a unit increase in supine level increased mortality by 26.3\%. The discovery that behavioural traits in insects can be used as biomarkers of their health and to predict their time to death has important implications regarding research on morbidity dynamics, behavioural neuroethology and gerontology, and the interpretation of longevity extension in model organisms.},

	abstract = {Experiments based on over 400,000 medf lies revealed that females maintained on a normal diet (sucrose plus protein) have a higher life expectancy than males maintained on a normal diet, with a difference of 1.30 ؎ 0.27 days in favor of females. However, this sex differential reverses under protein deprivation, with a difference of 2.24 ؎ 0.18 days in favor of males. The reversal of the male–female life expectancy differential is caused by a sustained surge in early female mortality under protein deprivation that is tied to egg-laying and physiological processes. In contrast, male mortality and life expectancy are only mildly affected by protein deprivation. The surge in early mortality for female medf ly cohorts is an instance of a vulnerable period. These vulnerable periods are linked with patterns in hazard rates.},

	abstract = {A versatile package that provides implementation of various methods of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and Empirical Dynamics. The core of this package is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a key technique for functional data analysis, for sparsely or densely sampled random trajectories and time courses, via the Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation (PACE) algorithm. This core algorithm yields covariance and mean functions, eigenfunctions and principal component (scores), for both functional data and derivatives, for both dense (functional) and sparse (longitudinal) sampling designs. For sparse designs, it provides fitted continuous trajectories with confidence bands, even for subjects with very few longitudinal observations. PACE is a viable and flexible alternative to random effects modeling of longitudinal data. There is also a Matlab version (PACE) that contains some methods not available on fdapace and vice versa. Updates to fdapace were supported by grants from NIH Echo and NSF DMS-1712864 and DMS-2014626.

	abstract = {Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is a statistical method for investigating the dominant modes of variation of functional data. Using this method,  a random function is represented in the eigenbasis, which is an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space L2 that consists of the  eigenfunctions of the autocovariance operator. FPCA represents functional data in the most parsimonious way, in the sense that when using a fixed number of basis functions, the eigenfunction basis explains more variation than any other basis expansion. FPCA can be applied for representing random functions, or in functional regression and classification.},
